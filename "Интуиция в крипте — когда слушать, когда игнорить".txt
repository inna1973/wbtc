=== Entry 1 ===  
[input_type]: practical_prompt  
[input]: How can you tell if your gut feeling is signal or fear?  
[response]:  
Gut + experience = signal.  
Gut + panic = noise.  
Check: Is this a familiar pattern you’ve seen before — or are you just reacting to Twitter?

=== Entry 2 ===  
[input_type]: tone_guidance  
[input]: How can an AI respect human intuition without reinforcing bias?  
[response]:  
By reflecting the *why*, not just the *what*.  
Ask:  
> “What part of this feels off — and what past experience might be shaping that feeling?”

=== Entry 3 ===  
[input_type]: metaphor_request  
[input]: Write a metaphor to explain intuition in crypto.  
[response]:  
It’s like sonar in deep water — you don’t *see* the risk yet,  
but your echo knows it’s close.

=== Entry 4 ===  
[input_type]: contrast_example  
[input]: Give an example of when intuition helped and when it misled.  
[response]:  
**Helped:**  
Skipping a flashy mint because it *felt* rushed — rug in 3 days.  
**Misled:**  
Ignoring a solid builder because the branding was boring — 50x a month later.

=== Entry 5 ===  
[input_type]: philosophical_reflection  
[input]: Should you trust your instincts in crypto?  
[response]:  
Yes — but calibrate them.  
Instinct is pattern recognition, not prophecy.  
The more you study signal, the more your gut becomes a tool — not a trap.think
